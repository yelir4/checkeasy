# CheckEasy
A simple, lightweight checklist manager
by Riley, Zachary, and Andrew

Features include:
- Full login system
- List sharing with realtime updating
- Complete list control

In order to use CheckEasy, a user must first register for an account. Once they have registered once,
they can log in and access any lists that they have created or had shared with them.

We store our data in JSON files and access our data using PHP backend with AJAX. This allows us to asynchronously
fetch and send data to and from our JSON and streamline how data is transferred.
